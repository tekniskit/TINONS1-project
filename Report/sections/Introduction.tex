\section{Introduction}

The idea behind the project is to recognise the speaker using the methods and categorisers learned in the course pattern recognition and machine learning (TINONS). The voices of all authors was recorded and imported to matlab. The features from the data was extracted in matlab using the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient(Hereafter MFCC) method from the voicebox toolbox. The MFCC's are used as features for the classifiers that are tested in this paper.
