\section{Data Gathering}
The data used in this project was gathered by recording three different persons reading the same article from the website "www.tv2.dk". The voices was recorded using the software Audacity\footnote{http://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/} and the Lame mp3 codex\footnote{http://lame.sourceforge.net/}. The data is then imported into matlab using the function \texttt{[data, Fs] = audioread(pathToFile)}. The data is then normalised by removing the mean of the data, and whitening the data. The files are in stereo and both channels are used by appending one channel to the other so to have one long array of data.
